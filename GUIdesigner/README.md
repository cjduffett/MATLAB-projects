GUI designer
===============

Do you know those times when you have a really good idea or reason to make a GUI but you don't.
Because you know the code is lengthy and you are lazy and no one knows how to use guide.
Well, no worries. From now on you can use the GUI designer. With a easy-to-use interface, anyone 
can  create GUIs with multiple objects in seconds.

1. First, open up the GUIdesigner and pick where you want to save your file

2. Now you pick an object on the right-hand side of the screen

3. When you click on it, you have the option to change some of it's properties. 
   When you are done click on "Enter Properties"

4. Now, you have to pick two points for any two opposite vertices of the object you are creating
   Simply, click on the canvas on the left once to set your reference origin and the second 
   time to draw the object.

5. You can add as many features as you want and once you are done, just close the designer, 
   open the .m file generated and you are ready to start coding the back-end.
